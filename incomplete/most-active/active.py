"""Find window of time when most authors were active.

For example::

    >>> data = [
    ...    ('Alice', 1901, 1950),
    ...    ('Bob',   1920, 1960),
    ...    ('Carol', 1908, 1945),
    ...    ('Dave',  1951, 1960),
    ... ]

    >>> most_active(data)
    (1920, 1945)

(Alice, Bob, and Carol were all active then).

If there's more than one period, find the earliest::

    >>> data = [
    ...    ('Alice', 1901, 1950),
    ...    ('Bob',   1920, 1960),
    ...    ('Carol', 1908, 1945),
    ...    ('Dave',  1951, 1960),
    ...    ('Eve',   1955, 1985),
    ... ]

    >>> most_active(data)
    (1920, 1945)

(Alice, Bob, Carol were active 1920-1945. Bob, Dave, and Eve were active 1951-1960.
Since there's a tie, the first was returned)
